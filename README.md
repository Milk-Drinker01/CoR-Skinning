# CoR-Skinning
 Optimized Center of Rotation skinning in unity
The majority of this code is not mine - it comes from CodeKiwi on the unity forums ([link]https://forum.unity.com/threads/cor-real-time-skeletal-skinning-with-optimized-centers-of-rotation.634435/#post-8102801)

this is a wip repo that i only recommend looking through if you hate yourself. im actively working on making it more user friendly and faster
