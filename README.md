# CoR-Skinning
 Optimized Center of Rotation skinning in unity

The majority of this code is not mine - it comes from CodeKiwi on the unity forums ([link](https://forum.unity.com/threads/cor-real-time-skeletal-skinning-with-optimized-centers-of-rotation.634435/#post-8102801))

this is a wip repo that i only recommend looking through if you hate yourself. im actively working on making it more user friendly and faster

an extereme example of the built in LBS skinning vs CoR skinning:
