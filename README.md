# CoR-Skinning
 Optimized Center of Rotation skinning in unity

The majority of this code is not mine - it comes from CodeKiwi on the unity forums ([link](https://forum.unity.com/threads/cor-real-time-skeletal-skinning-with-optimized-centers-of-rotation.634435/#post-8102801))

this is a wip repo that i only recommend looking through if you hate yourself. im actively working on making it more user friendly and faster (its currently about 83% the speed of built in skinning)

I also plan to include shaders for all render pipelines. the current provided shaders are for built in, but expect the hdrp shaders to be the most fleshed out

an extereme example of the built in LBS skinning vs CoR skinning:
